        "Handling exceptions in concurrent programs is crucial as it unhandled errors can disrupt multiple threads or processes, leading to instability, resource leakage, and incorrect behavior. In multi-threaded and multi-process environments, exceptions in one thread or process can propagate unpredictably, affecting the entire system. Techniques for handling exceptions include using `try-except` blocks within each thread/process, `concurrent.futures` to capture exceptions from worker threads/processes, `Queue` for passing errors between processes, and `logging` for tracking errors. Additionally, `try-finally` blocks ensure proper resource cleanup even if an exception occurs, maintaining program stability and resource integrity."
